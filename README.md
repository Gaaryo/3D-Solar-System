# Project 7: Solar System Simulation ðŸŒŒ

## Overview
This project is a 3D solar system simulation. It features textured spheres representing the Sun, planets, and moons, each with unique animations to simulate their rotation and relative dynamics.

The simulation provides a visual representation of planetary motion and lighting effects, showcasing realistic textures and a central light source for illumination.

## Features
1. **Accurate Planetary Dynamics**:
   - Simulates day and night cycles with planetary rotations at different speeds.
   - Includes 10 textured spheres representing the Sun and nine celestial bodies.

2. **Realistic Textures**:
   - Textures sourced from the internet for Earth, Moon, Venus, and other planets.
   - Textures applied to create a visually accurate appearance.

3. **Central Lighting**:
   - The Sun serves as a light source, illuminating planets with realistic shading.
   - Light placed inside the Sun to brighten its surface while lighting other bodies.

4. **Animation**:
   - Planets rotate on their axes.
   - Basic animations simulate planetary motion.

## Differences from the Proposal
1. **No Orbital Paths**:
   - Orbital paths were omitted as planets appeared too close to one another, making the orbits visually unappealing.

2. **Scaled-Down Distances**:
   - Interplanetary distances were adjusted to allow all planets to remain visible within the scene.

## Clever Design Elements
- **Innovative Lighting**:
  - A single light source was placed inside the Sun to make its surface glow naturally while also illuminating the planets. This reduced the need for multiple light sources.

---

## What I Learned
- Gained knowledge on placing light sources inside objects to create realistic illumination effects.
- Simplified lighting design by using one light source instead of six for the Sun.
